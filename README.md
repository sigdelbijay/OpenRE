# OpenRE

Open Relation Extraction(OpenRE) application takes SQUAD 2.0 Dataset and creates new SQUAD 2.0 Dataset with paraphrased questionnaires. It either takes paragraphs and questions array in ["question a", "question b] form from SQUAD 2.0 Dataset and create new questions or it takes whole/part of SQUAD 2.0 Dataset and regenerates the whole dataset. As the regeneration of whole dataset takes hours to finish there is option to download already created new SQUAD 2.0 Dataset which has been created using this application.
